            <h2>CSS Variables</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlighted">
                    Custom properties (sometimes referred to as CSS variables or cascading variables) are entities
                    defined by CSS authors that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document.
                    They are set using custom property notation (e.g., --main-color: black;)
                    and are accessed using the var() function (e.g., color: var(--main-color);).
                </span>
                Complex websites have very large amounts of CSS, often with a lot of repeated values. For example, the
                same color might be used in hundreds of different places, requiring global search and replace if that
                color needs to change. Custom properties allow a value to be stored in one place, then referenced in
                multiple other places. An additional benefit is semantic identifiers. For example, --main-text-color is
                easier to understand than #00ff00, especially if this same color is also used in other contexts.

                Custom properties are subject to the cascade and inherit their value from their parent.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>At-rules</h2>

            <p>
                <span>
                    At-rules are CSS statements that instruct CSS how to behave. They begin with an at sign, '@' (U+0040
                    COMMERCIAL AT), followed by an identifier and includes everything up to the next semicolon, ';'
                    (U+003B SEMICOLON), or the next CSS block, whichever comes first.
                </span>
                Much like the values of properties, each at-rule has a different syntax. Nevertheless, several of them
                can be grouped into a special category named conditional group rules. These statements share a common
                syntax and each of them can include nested statements—either rulesets or nested at-rules. Furthermore,
                they all convey a common semantic meaning—they all link some type of condition, which at any time
                evaluates to either true or false. If the condition evaluates to true, then all of the statements within
                the group will be applied.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>@media</h2>

            <p>
                <span>
                    The @media CSS at-rule can be used to apply part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more
                    media queries.
                </span>
                With it, you specify a media query and a block of CSS to apply to the document if and only if the media
                query matches the device on which the content is being used.
